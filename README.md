## Implement a ChatBubble component that fulfils the next requirements

-Display a list of messages –between 2 or more users- with different types i.e. text, image, and voice to start with.

-Has inputs to send a message of said types.

-It has a customizable title, avatar, and accent color.

-Support RTL and LTR.

-Support Localization

-Auto expand to full screen if opened on mobile view.

-Its initial state is collapsed as a circle that can be expanded on click, the same as a regular chat bubble.

-Use it in an example empty page and mock messages source i.e. as a local array

-Treat the component as if it’s in a component library for others to use, so make sure it’s extendable i.e. other message types.

-Make sure no component does more than it should.

*Prefer to use typescript.
